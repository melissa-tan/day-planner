# Day Planner
This repository contains a web application made with html, css, javascript, focusing on third party APIs such as jQuery, Bootstrap, and Moment.
This day planner allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.  The planner shows the current day and timeblocks for standard business hours which is color coded by past(grey), present(red), and future(green) times. A user can enter an event in the input box and save their input to localStorage. When the user refreshes the page, the saved event persists.
